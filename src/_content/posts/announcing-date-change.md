# DjangoCon US is changing dates!

Due to a very large conference happening in Chicago the week of September 14 that is causing hotel prices to skyrocket (over $400 per night for nearby hotels), DjangoCon US is moving to the week of August 24.

This will help keep costs more affordable for our guests, and maybe Lake Michigan will be warm enough for people who would like to take a morning swim!

## Schedule

- Monday, August 24 through Wednesday, August 26: Talks
- Thursday, August 27 and Friday, August 28: Sprints

We apologize for the inconvenience for anyone who has already made travel plans.

We look forward to seeing you in Chicago!
